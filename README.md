## Level Of Achievement
Apollo

## Aim
We wish to connect donors with surplus food to recipients who need it through a mobile app. However, due to time constraints, we will be focusing on the Android platform.


## Motivation
The rising issue of food waste and food insecurity is what motivates us to develop the food donation app, FoodBridge.

Across the world, there is a serious problem with food waste and food insecurity. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations estimates that every year, almost one-third of all food produced worldwide is lost or wasted. Meanwhile, food insecurity is also a significant problem, with millions of people around the world lacking reliable access to nutritious food.

A food donation app like FoodBridge aims to address these issues by connecting donors with others within the region. By making it easier for to donate excess food, we can reduce food waste and redirect valuable resources to those in need. This not only benefits the recipients of the food donations but also has environmental and economic benefits by reducing the amount of food waste that ends up in landfills.

In addition, FoodBridge can help build stronger communities by fostering connections between donors and recipients within the same neighborhood. By bringing people together to address a shared challenge, we can promote a sense of social responsibility and empathy, and work towards a more sustainable and equitable future.

## User Stories
